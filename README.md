# ECMA Mob Charter


## Thesis:

Developers of all kinds seem to face a number of common problems. The most prevalent seem to be:

  1. It's easy to get bogged down trying to perfect one project.
  2. It can be hard to meaningfully collaborate with developers of different disciplines.
  3. It is hard to get eyes on the work you share.

ECMA Mob is my solution to tackling these three problems.

There's obviously a benefit to looking at a problem from different perspectives to help you find an apparent solution.

Personally, I think we should be looking at the meta problems of being a modern developer from the perspective of hip hop musicians.

  1. They typically have a few different projects going at once.
  2. They feature, co-produce, or otherwise collaborate with a lot of other artists.
  3. They release their art into the world and just let it be. They let others remix their work.

Think of your code in terms of "Singles", "Mixtapes", and "Albums". Find reasons to collaborate and put your art out into the world, even if what you built is small. Use it to teach someone something. Write a blog post, Tweet some example code, create a tutorial...

We'll all be better off for it.

## What ECMA Mob Is About:

  * Developer Collaboration - Working together is cooler than working alone. Lean on each other to build something you wouldn't be able to on your own. We all have a lot to learn from each other.
  * Building Cool Stuff - Don't wait for inspiration. Build whatever comes to mind, and build it often. You never know what project might inspire a bigger idea down the line.
  * Moving On After Projects - When you release a project to the public, move on to something new. Let your work just be what it is. You'll learn more from executing on a new idea than tinkering with an old one..
  * Hyping Each Other - We're all doing cool things. Hype each other up. Get eyes on each others' projects, blog posts, or whatever else we're all working on. More criticism (positive or negative) means more avenues for growth.
  * Learning In Public - Read this. Live this. The best way to learn is to teach others. Pass your knowledge on. No matter how little you might think you know, there's always someone who can glean something from your knowledge and experience.

## What ECMA Mob Isn't About:

  * **This space intentionally left blank.**

I don't want to put any limits on what this could grow to be. Everyone in this collective will help shape what it is.

## There are only two rules:

  1. Don't be a jerk.
  2. This Charter must exist in every new iteration of this ECMA Mob site.

## Collaborate -> Build -> Release -> Hype -> Teach.
